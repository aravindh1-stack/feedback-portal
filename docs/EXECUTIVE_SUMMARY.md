# Executive Summary

The College Feedback Portal is an enterprise-grade, web-based platform that streamlines the collection, analysis, and reporting of academic feedback across students, faculty, and administrators. It enables institutions to make data-driven decisions, improve teaching quality, and maintain transparent stakeholder communication with robust security and compliance.

## Key Value Propositions
- Enhanced Educational Quality: Data-driven insights enable continuous improvement.
- Streamlined Communication: Direct feedback channels between stakeholders.
- Automated Reporting: Real-time analytics and customizable report generation.
- Scalable Architecture: Supports varied institutional sizes and complexities.
- Role-Based Access Control: Secure, permission-based system access.

## Vision & Mission
- Vision: A unified platform that empowers institutions to collect, analyze, and act on feedback effectively, fostering continuous improvement.
- Mission: Deliver a robust, user-friendly, and scalable system that centralizes all feedback-related activities, promoting transparency, accountability, and data-driven decisions.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Colleges, universities, and training centers.
- Secondary: Corporate training orgs and professional development centers.
- End Users: Students, faculty, admin staff, and leadership.

## Core Functional Modules
- Authentication & Authorization: Multi-role auth, JWT with refresh, RBAC, optional 2FA.
- Student Portal: Dynamic forms, autosave, feedback history, notifications, accessibility.
- Faculty Portal: Analytics dashboards, filters, trend and comparative analysis, exports.
- Admin Portal: User management, drag-and-drop form builder with versioning, reports, system settings.
- Special: Chief Guest Feedback for events with real-time collection and post-event analytics.

## Technical Architecture (Frontend Focus)

- Compliance: FERPA, GDPR considerations, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility.
- Observability: Metrics, logs, and tracing; performance budgets and code splitting; caching.

## Roadmap Snapshot
- Phase 0: Foundations (tooling, CI/CD).
- Phase 1: Auth & RBAC.
- Phase 2: Student MVP (forms, autosave, submit, history).
- Phase 3: Faculty analytics.
- Phase 4: Admin form builder.
- Phase 5: Reports & scheduling.
- Phase 6: Chief Guest module.
